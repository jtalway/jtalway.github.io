REMI : In this video, I'm going to show you that scanif is sometimes dangerous,
both for programmers and users.
Here is an example with a program that asks for my family name,
then first, name then age.
And when I run it, if I put spaces, it will split the string with the spaces.
Look at that.
What is your family name?
Sharrock
And then Space, and I will put my first name, Remi, and then
Space, and then my age, 18.
And when I will hit Enter, it will feed the two other questions
with Remi and 18.
It means that scanif split the first input with those two spaces.
So Sharrock is the answer of family name, Remi the answer of first name,
and 18 of age.
So it means that scanf is splitting both on new lines
and also on space lines.
So if you don't want to have this behavior and by the way.
It's quite dangerous to do that.
To use scanf with a user interaction to get a string is very dangerous.
So you should use other ways to do that, and you should learn
how to program C with other courses.
But here, I will get you some hints.
Instead of scanf before a string, you should use both f get s.
But then you will have all the spaces and also
the new line character at the end.
So you will get all the characters, even the newline characters.
So you will have to get rid of that character if you don't want it.
Also, you can use getline.
And getline is a function that is compatible on POSIX systems,
so not all of the systems.
And also, you can use on Linux the gnureadline,
but it's only compatible on Linux operating systems.
So if you want to know more about those functions,
you can search on the internet.
And if you want to know more how to program in C,
I invite you to take other courses on how to program in C.
