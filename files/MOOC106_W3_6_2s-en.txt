REMI : Imagine that you have a program that
is waiting for a user input and that, by mistake, you hit the Run It button,
then you will be stuck on web Linux.
Let me show you that.
Here, you have a program that says : "please enter to exit".
So I will run it.
All right.
And here it is waiting for the user input to enter something.
But here, because we don't have the prompt, if you hit the Run It button,
then webLinux will try to put some commands to execute the compiler,
and to compile and to execute the program,
but it doesn't do anything, because this is the input of the user that
is waiting here.
So the status is that webLinux is stuck,
because it didn't start the compilation program,
and the compiler is still compiling, because it is not doing anything.
It is inputting the commands into the input of the program that
is waiting for the user input.
So, anyway, you are kind of stuck, and those buttons are disabled.
So if you are in such a situation, you can still
reboot webLinux by refreshing the browser, the page on which you are,
on which you have webLinux, and it will reboot webLinux,
and you will still get your program on which you were working.
And it will enable again the Save It and Run It buttons.
