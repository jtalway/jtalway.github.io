REMI : Let's see some bonus commands,
bonus programs that are installed on WebLinux that are usually not
installed on Linux.
These are usually games.
So the first one that I just installed is the hello command.
And it's a very simple one.
Because when you type hello, it says, Hello world.
So it's a very famous Hello world program.
Then I have installed worm.
worm like this.
And it's a kind of simulation in text.
Very basic ones with three worms going around like this.
And to exit the program, I guess that the q key is working.
So it stopped the simulation because you can see that you
have the command prompt back again.
Let's go back to worm.
And let's try this time the Control-C. Control-C.
And, indeed, if we go back to the command prompt, let's try to firework.
firework.
Ooh.
And you have a beautiful simulation of fireworks going around with texts.
This is very, very old school.
But I like it a lot.
Let's try Control-C to quit the program.
Yep.
It just stopped the simulation in the middle.
And let's try rain.
rain.
And you can see some rain drops just here.
Control-C to stop.
So the same.
Let's try again.
hanoi.
It's the Hanoi Tower game.
So here you can try to play with this game.
And as you can see, you have to read what you have to do.
And if you don't know what is the Hanoi Tower game,
then just try to find it on Wikipedia, and it will explain what to do.
But here next move from, I can see I have three towers.
One, two, three.
So let's try from one to two.
Enter.
Oh.
No.
I did not have to type Enter.
All right.
So it moved the top of the first, the bottom of the two.
Let's try to move one to three.
Yeah.
It worked.
One to two.
All right.
Two to three.
All right.
So you understood that some moves are forbidden.
But I will let you explore this Towers of Hanoi game
and see if you are able to solve it by yourself.
Q to quit.
So Q.
All right.
And the last is knight.
knight like this.
So it's a logical Solitaire.
And you have to read what's happening here.
So it's a text game.
And it says you can move around with the arrow keys.
So, indeed, if I move with my keys, I can get
through this board, some kind of board.
And other commands allow you to undo moves or redraw.
Your mouse may work, but not here, because it's WebLinux.
And then you have X or Q to exit.
And well, you have to press the question mark to go to the game explanation.
Let's do that.
And blah, blah, blah.
So you have the explanation.
So I will quit this program.
Try again.
OK.
Q. And well, I will let you play if you want to try this game.
And I just showed you some of the commands that I installed just for fun.
